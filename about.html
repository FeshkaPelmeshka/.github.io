    <h2>The Problem We Are Solving</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>80% of trade documents are still handled manually</li>
      <li>Fragmented formats and no standardisation slow down processing</li>
      <li>Manual workflows introduce delays, errors, and fraud risks</li>
      <li>SMEs and mid-tier players lack access to digitisation tools used by top-tier banks</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>That is why we came up with a solution: TradeDocAI.</strong></p>

        <div class="bio">
          <p>I started my career as a full-stack developer and later transitioned into strategy and sales leadership roles after earning my MBA at INSEAD.</p>
          <p>Over the past 13+ years, I have worked across banks, FinTechs, and SaaS startups, specializing in trade finance and digital transformation. I am ICC-certified in Trade Finance, with deep knowledge of trade processes and standards.</p>
          <p>I spent 7+ years building and selling SaaS platforms for the trade finance industry, where I saw first-hand that the manual re-entry of data from paper documents into digital systems is one of the key blockers to adoption — a point frequently raised by senior bankers during product demos.</p>
          <p>My combined expertise in product, strategy, trade finance, blockchain, and data privacy uniquely positions me to build an API-first, AI-powered Trade Document Intelligence Platform that solves this critical market need.</p>
